# One Ring Rentals Web Application Assessment

## Assessment Description

In this assessment, you will demonstrate your ability to apply object-oriented language skills using the relevant industry-standard language (e.g., OO React, Next.js). The web application, built through Next.js sessions, is for the "One Ring Rentals" client scenario.

### Assessment Method

You will complete a series of tutorial tasks to build a web-based program using an object-oriented programming language. These tasks will be guided by the design and requirements for the "One Ring Rentals" application project.

Your web-based program is expected to:
- Use relevant language syntax and basic OO principles.
- Adhere to technology coding standards for layout (components).
- Include in-code documentation.
- Create, use, and document testing of code (provide screenshots).
- Test the site in browsers and on two devices (provide screenshots).

## Assessment Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**: Use the "One Ring Rentals" prototype from "Assessment 2: Project â€“ Build web page using components" available on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Framework and Conversion**: Construct the application using the Next.js React framework. Utilise components from "Assessment 2" and convert them to Next.js framework.

3. **State Management**: Implement state management to track user data between components, similar to the blog example in the Next.js tutorial.

4. **Content Integration**: Convert the blog example to include content relevant to the "One Ring Rentals" pages.

5. **Hosting Platform Research**: Research suitable hosting platforms for React libraries and Next.js frameworks. Provide links to references.

6. **Deployment**: Upload your application to your chosen hosting platform. Submit the deployment link along with your assessment submission on Blackboard.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to follow GitHub Classroom instructions provided by your Lecturer.
- Document your progress and include necessary screenshots in your submission.

    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed Assessment updates"
